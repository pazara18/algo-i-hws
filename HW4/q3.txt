Part 1) 
If using the same structure, we create three dierent bonds according to dierent x,y, z values.
This will practically be like 3 different trees. Since the insertion time complexity is O(t*log(tn)),
time complexity for this type of tree will be also O(t*log(tn)).

Part 2)
If we put mini B trees in nodes, if we have n nodes and mini b-trees have m nodes, since we will visit
n nodes and and insert new element to a mini b tree with m elements time complexity will be O(nt*log(tm)).
